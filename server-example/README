server w/ a simple endpoint taking a queryparam representing url to request server side & translating
 into the actual ssrf request

The idea here is if triggering ssrf requires a complex payload, session management, etc
it's easier to use w/ tools like ffuf if we can just pass the wordlist as simple query param
